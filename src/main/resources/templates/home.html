                    <p class="text-center">Tech{knowledge}y is the culmination of an 18-week transformation into professional programmers. As students, one of our greatest assets is the knowledge that others possess and one of man's greatest gifts is the passing of the torch from one generation to the next. As we stepped into this new world, we found ourselves inundated with information, but frustrated by our fragmented access to help. After struggling to find the sort of tech knowledge we sought, we decided to used what we've learned to light our own torch that we're proud to pass on to those after us. We are helping put the knowledge back into tech</p>

                            Classmates use words like "helpful" and "knowledgeable" when describing Graham. A natural-born teacher, due to his extraordinary communication and people skills, he spent many hours teaching others.

                            The infinity symbol embodies the synergistic dynamic between student and mentor. It represents equality, the cyclical nature of learning, and the timelessness of knowledge. Students don't just learn from their mentors, they also teach and go on to become mentors themselves. The relationship between student and mentor is reciprocal.
